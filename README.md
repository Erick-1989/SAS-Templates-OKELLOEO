# Repeated Measures Analysis

Repeated measures occur whenever the same observation is taken sequentially on the same object, usually through time. This introduces a dependency within the subjectâ€™s observations.

Some advantages of repeated measure models are:

1. Will allow to monitor how treatment effect changes over time
2. Will produce more efficient estimates than non-repeated models allowing statistical inference to be made with fewer subjects
3. Will produce tests with higher power (i.e. if an effect exists, your statistical test is more likely to detect it).
